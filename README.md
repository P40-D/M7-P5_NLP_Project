# NLP Project

I've scraped the comments on a Reddit post about reviews of a videogame called "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl".  
I will use NLP to determine themes in the comments with the goal of classifying them into groups.

My Results show me that we can classify the comments into these three subject categories, determined by examining their most important words:

1. **Feedback and bugs:** great, bugs, xbox, patches, patch
2. **AI and Engine:** ai, good, engine, bugs, veilguard (AI refering to the enemies in the game)
3. **Comparing with Cyberpunk:** cyberpunk, lol, yeah, hell, expected (Cyberpunk is a game that famously launched with a lot of bugs)
4. **Negative Feedback:** bugs, war, issues, jank, fixed
